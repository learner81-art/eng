For example, if they live in a society without **a** legal system they may experience enormous problems in daily **life**, such as fraud and robbery. For instance, if they do not obey the traffic laws**,** car accidents will increase and traffic congestion can become **a** daily occurrence, which may damage **the** economy. However, laws may sometimes restrict freedom inevitably and even hamper **social progress**, when the business world has many restrictions or high income tax rates. Despite this, it is reasonable to conclude that**,** without laws and rules**,** society may not function well, although restrictive laws could also be a problem.
