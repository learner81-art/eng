\f2\fs24 \cf2 The topic argues that whether universities should concentrate on knowledge and skills that will be used in workplace. I believe theories and practical skills are importance to graduates advancement.\
\
On the one hand, it is very important for graduates to develop essential abilities in universities. The reason is that the phase is crucial for them to form by learning the knowledge that enable them to understand the principle and become parts of their personality. For example, honest and respect are most important among the classmates , helping them work closely together and achieve their common goal.\
\
On the other hand, universities should also focus on practical skills for their career advancement. The students who gain insight into theories may have competitive edge in the job markets, which enable them to find jobs that  earn higher salaries or match interests . For example, they can use mathematical skills to  build model for analyzing data , so they may work as IT engineer after graduation, and make a decent living.\
\
In my opinion, universities should emphasize on the development of students in different areas. They are more likely to advance their career easily if students have a grasp of knowledge that can boost their good qualities. For instance, they can form some good qualities by receiving morality knowledge,  such as integrity and creativity. Meanwhile, they require to learn professional knowledge and practical skills, including foreign language skills and computer skills.Therefore, after graduation they may gain more promotional opportunities with their professional theories based on empirical knowledge and good qualities that manifest their working efficiency. \
\
\
\
\
\
Many people pay attention to their job satisfaction that include different factors. I do not believe it is rational to meet their expectations of jobs for all workers.\
\
There are some factors that make individuals feel job satisfaction if it can enrich their lives. These elements enable people to achieve their common goals. For example, It is important for people to earn more money and gain promotional opportunities. Meanwhile, others may choose jobs that match their interests and enjoy the friendly working environment. Therefore, they can not only pursue their career advancement , but also make a decent living.\
\
It is not realistic to meet job satisfaction for all individuals. One reason is that the competitive between employers in the job markets is stiff.  For instance, the technology develop so fast that many people find it difficult to keep up with the requirements of changing market trending and consumers preferences, so they may not gain more money or even keep their works .\
\
Another reason is that it is not easy to find jobs that offer relaxation work environment. Fast-paced lifestyle forces many workers to sacrifice their lives and even health. For instance, 
\f0\b \cb1 \strike \strikec2 the
\f2\b0 \cb3 \strike0\striked0  people with heavy 
\f0\b workloads
\f2\b0  may not have adequate time to rest , and this is the main reason why they suffer from stress, 
\f0\b \cb1 \strike \strikec2 that
\f2\b0 \cb3 \strike0\striked0  
\f0\b which
\f2\b0  
\f0\b puts
\f2\b0  them at risk of 
\f0\b illnesses 
\f2\b0  such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Therefore, they find it difficult to keep work-life balance so they may feel frustrated\
\
In conclusion, there are some factors , such as higher salaries, promotional opportunities and 
\f0\b \cb1 \strike \strikec2 relaxation
\f2\b0 \cb3 \strike0\striked0  
\f0\b a relaxed 
\f2\b0 working environment, contributing to job satisfaction. It is not easy to meet individuals work expectations due to the stiff competition and heavy work load. \
\
The topics argues that if the environments and motivation of criminal behaviors should be considered. I believe that criminal behavior should be punished as well as it is crucial to understand the reasons of crime ,including situations and motivation.\
\
On the one hand, punishment is essential for people who obey the laws or rules.The society may not function well with punishment that have deterent effects on offenders. For example, people may experience enormous problems if they live in a society without legal punishment. To be more specific, if people do not obey the traffic laws, car accidents will increase and traffic congestion will become daily occurrence. As a result, the fine bills force people to modify their bad driving habits  , leading to maintain transportion efficiency.\
\
On the other hand, it is also important for punishment to think about situations and motivation of crimes. Punishment without considering these factors may isolate offenders from society and hinder them reintegration into it, or even increase the likelihood of reoffending after being released from the prison. For instance, although stiff punishment can reduce the crime wave, prison sentence are harmful to teenagers who steal money to buy food because of poverty, because criminal records can cast a long shadow to their careers.
\f3 \'c2\'db\'be\'dd\'ba\'cd\'be\'d9\'c0\'fd\'b7\'b4\'c1\'cb\'a3\'ac\'bc\'d3\'c9\'e7\'c7\'f8\'bd\'cc\'d3\'fd
\f2 \
\
In my opinion, It is important to understand the root causes of criminal behavior. Punishments should not only concentrate on social efficiency but also consider the justice of society.For example, some young people consider it necessary to follow fashion, which means that they always overspent because they may not have the good spending habits , so they may become self-fish and greedy, leading to criminal behaviors.It is rational to  impose stiff punishments on these teenagers , which can help them boost experiences in decision-making.

\f2 \
\
\
The topic argues that whether people could be taught to become a good sports person or musician. I believe that people can become an excellent person in some fields by discovering their potential abilities.\
\
On the one hand, talents enable people to achieve successful goals in some fields. The reason is that they can gain higher attainment than others who need to spend more time and energy.For example, people who have some talents are more likely to have a grasp of all principles of subjects and put it into practices. To be more specific, a basket ball player can get more scores than other team members, which can become the core of team and help their team to win the game.\
\
On the other hand, others believe any children can strive for excellence if they are taught in an appropriate way. If teachers can encourage them to think creatively and use the effective method, boosting the learning efficiency, because most of children may have the similar capabilities such as numeracy or literacy.For example, remembering time tables by rote is not the best way to improve their numeracy, while using multimedia tools can make them more concentration and keep interested.\
\
In my opinion,  children have their advantages in different fields, such as language, science, sports.They are easier to achieve success if they can discover their talents or hobbies. For instance, some children are good at running caused by strong physical conditions, while others enjoy learning languages by good memories. Meanwhile, teachers should choose suitable methods that adapt to different children to boost their ability and increase knowledge according to their own competitive edges. Therefore, children are able to be successful at some fields.\
\
Rising level of the average weight of people lead to growing health issues in some countries. I think that the reason is that people may not have healthy dietary habits and rely solely on modern technology, and they can solve the problems by developing healthy lifestyle.\
\
Unhealthy dietary habits may have a negative effect on their health. People enjoy fast food that are high in fat, salt , sugar and calories , and is also served in large portion. For example, fast food chains provide American or European food, such as fried chicken, hamburgers and pizzas. Therefore, people who suffer from obesity are more likely to contract heart diseases and high blood pressure.\
\
Inactive lifestyle is result of their tendency to rely heavily on modern technology. People spend too much time on social media and video games, so they may not do exercises regularly that may lead to an increase with the average weight of people, although it encourages people to socialize and reduce stress. As a result, a sedentary job or habit may put them at risk of illness.\
\
There are two solutions to the problem. First of all, doing exercise regularly can help people keep fit and burn calories , on other words, it is a better to lose weight. For example, running \cb1 \strike \strikec2 can\cb3 \strike0\striked0  enables people to enjoy the fresh air , get closer to nature and reduce the their weight. Meanwhile, it is necessary to develop a health eating habits, For instance, they need to eat some vegetables and fruits that are rich in vitamins and fibers, helping them to control their absorbed calories.\
\
In conclusion, people may suffer from obesity because of unhealthy dietary habits and inactive lifestyle , and the problem can be resolved by doing exercise regularly and developing a healthy eating habits.\
\
\
The topic argues that whether raising the price of petrol is the best method to mitigate increasing traffic and pollution issues. I disagree with the idea in part, because this method may not confront with the environmental problems and traffic congestion, and it is a better way to develop public transportation and alternative energy resources.\
\
Raising the price of petrol may not resolve the traffic problem. The changed cost of fossil fuel may not prevent people from working or traveling, which are crucial to maintain their lives by earning money and reducing stress.For example, many people need to travel to and from work by cars ,especially those who live away from the centre of cities. Therefore, it may not only not alleviate the traffic problem , but also impose an economic burden on general public.\
\
Meanwhile, increasing the price of petrol may not resolve the environmental pollution. People may have  no choice but to rely on fossil fuels that can generate the greenhouse gases and contribute to global warming. 
\f3 \'a3\'a8
\f2 People may not have too many choices other than relying on fossil fuels, which generate greenhouse gases and contribute to global warming.
\f3 \'a3\'a9
\f2 For example, energy providers tend to offer more petrol if they find it easier to earn money by the policy because of higher profit margin. Therefore,  producers encourage consumers to use petrol for driving, leading to pollution.\
\
On the other hand, public transportation can reduce the carbon emissions and traffic jams, which can improve traffic efficiency in the rush hours and reduce environmental problems.In addition, The invention of electric vehicles can reduce the environmental cost of human activities. For example, many people are more likely to go green that could be regarded as a status symbol and cut down on the use of fossil fuels that lead to carbon emission\
\
In conclusion, it is not the best way to solve the increasing traffic congestion and environmental  pollution.  public transportation and electronic vehicles could be better ways to confront with these problems.\
\
People today tend to use modern technology such as mobile phones or the Internet to build or promote relationships. I believe that it is a positive development , improving working or communicating efficiency, although it may also lead to some problems.\
\
Modern technology enable people to build new connections with others, boosting cultural exchange and international cooperations. Globalization means that the countries are interconnected, so people need to work with those from other cities or even countries.The modern technology such as mobile phones make it possible for people to communicate with colleagues and  clients from diverse backgrounds or cultures. For example, business people can make profits by engagement in international trade by offering a large number of food or household appliances for other countries where they need.\
\
Modern technology help people maintain relationships with their friends or family members. It is easier for people to keep in touch with family issues by social media, even though they have busy career and alway work overtimes.For example, they can share photos and videos online and receive feedback from their friends, who can celebrate their enjoyments or give them support and advice.\
\
On the other hand, modern technology make people have less face-to-face interaction. It is very important to react emotional requirements of family members or friends by this kind of  interaction , which can also improve the family bondings and communications.By comparison, young people in particular , are more likely to make new friends or socialize in the virtual room rather than in the real world, the negative effect of modern technological skills on communication varies across ages.\
\
In conclusion, I think that  modern technology can boost communication in  international settings and encourage people to maintain good relationships ,although it is not rational to ignore the face-to-face interaction.\
\
The topic discuss about whether schools should be responsible for helping students become good members in society. I believe that  parents should teach them the knowledge of how to become a member that benefit society, because school need to concentrate on children's learning tasks.\
\
On the one hand, parents should be good role models for their children's development.They have more life experience and care about them, so they tend to give them some sound advice that help them develop good habits.For example, children are able to show respect and politeness when they communicate with others, and help others positively if they need support. Therefore, they are able to contribute to society when they grow up.\
\
On the other hand, it is crucial for students to obey some rules in schools. The rules can help them develop good manners that enable them to understand the boundaries of behavior. For instance, teachers forbid students to use profanities or disrupt class.Otherwise, they will be removed from class as a method of punishment. As a result, they are able to tell right from wrong since they deeply realize the importance of following rules.\
\
I believe parents should concentrate on their development of ethics ,because schools need to focus on their learning tasks.Parents are more likely to understand their children's characters, which can help them develop good habits that are beneficial to physical and mental statue.For instance, looking after pets that promot a sense of responsibility.By comparison, teachers give priority to their academic performance of core disciplines that can determine whether they can have a grasp of every subjects which can broaden their mind and stimulate them to think creatively.\
\
The topic argues whether the disappear of languages is important. I agree in part with the idea that it is not important because people find it easier to exchange culture and improve economical development.  \
\
People may learn fewer languages with minimum effort rather than concentrating on others.They are more likely to focus on one or two major languages , so they can use several languages proficiently. For example, students can learn how to read, write and communicate several languages in different ways, which can help them overcome the language barriers in international settings. Otherwise, they may not have adequate time and energy to learn so many languages.
\f3 \'b8\'fc\'c9\'d9\'ca\'b1\'bc\'e4
\f2 \
\
People may gain benefits by learning fewer languages that are popular around the world ,rather than considering others. Some major languages can cover a large number of areas that improve the cultural exchange and international cooperation.For example, the people who can use English proficiently are more likely to draw inspiration from good practices, values and lifestyles by reading newspapers, magazines and books of English speaking countries.In addition, a good command of English can help people find work and earn higher salaries or even gain more promotional opportunities, because the ability to communicate with clients and colleagues from different backgrounds become increasingly important.
\f3 \'b8\'fc\'b6\'e0\'d0\'a7\'b9\'fb
\f2 \
\
On the other hand, disappeared languages may damage the cultural diversity.Several languages that have died out may be also a part of cultural heritage, which contain many wisdom and experiences related to the process of human development. For instance, people may not learn knowledge including laws, medicine or science ,if they can not understand some ancient languages.\
\
In conclusion, people can learn fewer languages and gain benefit easily, although cultural diversity will be affected adversely.\
\
\
The topic argues whether increasing the number of sports facilities could be the best way to have a positive effect on public health.I think that it is essential to concentrate on raising public health awareness, although sports facilities are also necessary.\
\
On the one hand, increased sports facilities can prompt people's health. Sports facilities enable people to do exercise regularly, which can expend their life span and reduce risk of illnesses.For example, The facilities in stadium allow people to run, climb and swim, which can not only help people keep fit ,show perseverance and boost coordination , but also can reduce stress and put them in a good mood.\
\
On the other hand, it is crucial to raise people's health awareness rather than only increasing the number of sports facilities. They may develop an health lifestyle if they know how harmful their ways of inactive life can be. For instance,Governments or health groups can disseminate knowledge about damaging effects of unhealthy lifestyle , if people may suffer from obesity that leads to health problems such as heart attach or high blood pressure due to the fact that they enjoy fast food and spend too much on video games.Therefore, they prefer to realize what they need to do for improving their health.\
\
In conclusion,  I believe that sports facilities may not affect positively people's health unless they have health awareness. Many people are addicted to some unhealthy lifestyle, making it difficult to change.For instance, it is common knowledge that smoking may damage people's health, they may not quit smoking unless they know how damaging their ways of life can be or even the governments pass the laws to forbid citizens to smoke publicly.

The topic argues whether high school students need to do volunteer works. I agree in part with the idea that doing volunteer services can encourage them to  contribute to society and boost their practical skills, although they may have less time on study.\
\
\
Volunteer work can encourage students to contribute to society. The reason is that they will find enjoyment in serving communities as they know how their works have a huge positive difference to other members of community.For example, it is a huge responsibility to assist disadvantaged students in schooling, and the high school students will realize that helping them to receive education can make for a fair and happy society.\
\
\
Another advantage is that volunteer services can provide them with opportunities to develop practical skills.They will be confronted with many problems and challenges that are rare at school ,because it requires a large number of useful skills ,such as problem-solving abilities, creativity and communication skills, although they only learn some theoretical knowledge which may not work closely in the real life. For instance, they should know how to cope with unexpected situations in flexible way , instead of sticking to some basic rules.\
\
\
On the other hand, volunteer services may have negative effect on their academic performance.They find it difficult to balance with volunteer services and study as they may not have adequate time to focus on learning tasks due to volunteer services.For instance, volunteer services may lead to poor grades and they may not achieve the ideal outcomes  that determine whether they can enter into the university, if they spend much time on volunteer work.\
\
In conclusion,  volunteer services can boost their kinds of abilities and encourage them to contribute to society, although it may impose pressure on their academic performance\
\
\
Some experts argue that learning a foreign language at primary school may have more advantages. I believe that students may have enough time and energy to learn and practice their foreign language skills.\
\
learning a foreign language at primary school can improve study efficiency.It is possible to adapt to the thinking patterns related to a foreign language if they live under the language environment, so they can use this language proficiently. For example, they can draw inspiration from good values, opinions and lifestyles from other countries by reading books, newspapers and magazines, which can benefit them.\
\
Pupils are more likely to be interested in learning a foreign language. They may have adequate time to enjoy learning foreign language skills as their learning tasks is so light that they can concentrate on a foreign language ,instead of disruption by other core disciplines.For example, they can learn this  in different ways, including books and games, helping them to learn better. Otherwise, middle school students may live under pressure to deal with foreign language because of upgrading.\
\
On the other hand, parents or teachers need to spend more time and energy in guiding pupils to learn a foreign language. The reason is that pupils lack self-discipline and may not master the essential learning methods. For instance, it is necessary for teachers and parents to find some learning materials such as videos or books, and teach these knowledge step by step.Meanwhile ,they also limit their screen time in cases where it may attract their concentration.\
 \
In conclusion, pupils can have learn a foreign language faster and easier as they are more likely to  be interested in it and study more efficiency, although parents and teachers may spend more time and energy.\
\
\
\
The topic discusses whether museums should charge for admission. I believe that the disadvantages outweigh advantages as museums should be free to broaden people's mind and gain more profits , although it can increase the cost of management.\
\
Museums that free the admission fee can help people expend their horizons. Museums are  key part of cultural heritage and visiting museums can help people increase their knowledge  that is interesting and educational.For example, they can visit the arts of work , such as sculptures, paintings and statues, which can experience diverse cultures first-hand and understand the historical events easily. \
\
Museums that do not charge admission fees may gain larger profits margin. Free admission can attract more visitors increasing rates of visiting, so museums can provide essential services  or sell souvenirs to earn higher money than admission fees. For instance, museums can  not only make profits by basic services, such as food and water, but also can enlarge their potential profits by selling architecture models or whistles and belts.\
\
On the other hand, it will increase the management cost if museums do not charge admission fees. The reason lies in the fact that museums may increase funding on relics protection in cases where some robbers or shoplifters may stolen or rob the precious items. For instance, museums have to recruit more staff or install more electronic devises to supervise or regulate the order of museums,  while admission fees can reduce the potential risk of destroy.\
\
In conclusion, museums do not charge for admission can help people expend their horizons and increase the profits, although it can also increase the cost of the management because of increased potential risk.\
\
The topic argues that people can buy the same products anywhere which countries tend to become similar. I believe this is an adverse development to some extent ,although people are able to enjoy their lives conveniently.\
\
Economy can be affected negatively as the same products lead to similar features of countries. The competition will become stiff because of monotonous production,For example, companies are unwilling to recruit new employees because of low-profit margin as increased competition forces local producers to cut their price and reduce spending on staff. Therefore, the business environment could be turbulent ,and even a well-established company can be shut down over night, which may lead to a depressive economically economy.\
\
It has a disadvantage effect on health because of similar lifestyle in different  countries. People today have a fast-paced lifestyle and are addicted to the  modern technology or fast food, which may result in unhealthy lifestyle.For example, this bad lifestyle is the result of their tendency to rely heavily on social media or video games, which will develop an inactive lifestyle ,and  reduce people's life span because of rising level of obesity that will put them at risk of illnesses, such as high blood pressure and heart disease.\

\f2 \
People can enjoy more freedom of production choices if it is possible to chase the same products anywhere. Massive production and technological innovation improve the work efficiency and reduce the cost of production, allowing people to pursue the products at a low price. For example, mechanization can increase the product supply and offer a wide range of goods choices, making it easier to have available options when people need to buy goods that meet their needs.Young people in particular, prefer to buy the latest mobile phones with the up-to-date features without higher price.\
\
In conclusion, this trend may have negative effect on economic development and people's health ,although it is possible for people to meet  their requirements in real life.\
\
\
\
This topic argues whether they should choose subjects that meet interests or social needs. I believe that they should learn subjects that match their interests and adapt to realistic requirements.\
\
\
University students who learn subjects that satisfy their interests are more likely to achieve ideal learning outcomes. The reason is that their hobbies can motive them to take education seriously and work hard to reach their potential, which may lead to higher academic standard. For example, some students have gift related to arts, such drawing , painting or music, making it easier to improve their concentration and imagination which can boost study efficiency .They can not only enjoy their interests and have a good academic performance ,but also work as a pianist who bring the perception of beauty to the general public after graduation.\
\
University students are more likely to find jobs easily if they can choose useful subjects. The advantage of learning subjects satisfying realistic needs is that  these kinds of theories have developed based on the empirical knowledge, which is important in the real life. Students are able to apply the knowledge and skills in the technological innovation, and  they gain more job opportunities and earn higher salaries.For example, they can learn mathematical knowledge to build model to analyze data and work as  financial analyst and engineer after graduation.\
\
I believe that university students should concentrate on both interests and job prospects, which can help  them reach their potentials and adapt to the needs of society.The reason lies in the fact that interests could be a driver of one's development , and their hobby could be supported if it can contribute to society and gain reward. For instance, some people who are fascinated mechanics are willing to make a good use of knowledge to design useful products which can make a decent living and benefit consumers. \

\
\
\
The topic argues whether punishment is necessary for children to learn this distinction between right and wrong at an early age. I disagree with the idea ,because it may have negative effect on their development rather than help them tell right from wrong.\
\
\
Punishment may lead to bad behaviors or cognitive rather than stimulate children to distinct right from wrong.Children tend to copy what their parents or teachers did , and they may have some behavioral problems if they live in a violent atmosphere. For example, they prefer to punish peers in wrong ways when they cope with the problems by themselves.By comparison, it is crucial for parents or teachers to help children learn how to distinguish   right from wrong, and they are able to develop good habits which can help them understand the boundaries of behaviors.
\f3 \'c4\'a3\'b7\'c2
\f2 \
\
\
Punishment have negative effect on their characters, instead of developing a sense of ethics.They may stick the rules without considering about whether they should obey the rules because of punishment, and it is difficult for them to develop problem-solving abilities, so they may not hand some unexpected situations flexibly. For instance,They may be less sociable and unwilling to communicate ideas with classmates due to the fact that they become coward and passive.By contrast, being patience shows that we respect others feelings ,and looking after pets can help develop a sense of responsibility.
\f3 \'bd\'a9\'bb\'af
\f2 \
\
On the other hand, punishment enables to force children to obey the rules and have a moral compass. For example, schools should allow teachers to remove them from classroom if they use profanities and disrupt the class. Meanwhile, parents may not satisfy their requirements such as pursuing toys or games , and limit their screen time.\
\
In conclusion, punishment may have negative effect on their characters and lead to wrong behaviors and cognitives, although it can serve as teaching aid.\
\
The topic is that whether people should concentrate on economic development as the most important factor. I agree with the idea in part , although other aspects of progress  are also significant.\
\
Some governments believe economic progress is the most important factor. Economy could be a driver of the society ,which provide the motivation or energy for other types of progress.Governments may allocate money to increase investment in other fields due to economic progress.For example , the top priority for a deprived economically country is to satisfy people's basic needs, while in a highly consumer society, people enable to have a decent quality of lives, including medical care , technological innovation.\
\
Others think that it is essential to develop other aspects of progress. The reason is that social development depends on all kinds of aspects , such as technology, psychology and environment rather than relies sorely on economy. For example, Governments need to pour much money on environmental protection, which can help people keep fit and increase life span. Otherwise, it is short-sighted for profits to damage the environment as many afforestation is attributed to human activities.Therefore, environment will be in a dire state , which may have negative effect on people's health and economic development.\
\
I believe that it is crucial to give priority to economic development , although other aspects are also important. Money is the great motivation to accelerate the social development . For example,  it is expensive to increase spending on welfare services , and aging population force governments to raise their statutory retirement age due to aging population
\f3 \'a3\'ac

\f2  if governments do not focus on other fields. To be more specific, people may experience enormous problems

\
\
The topic is whether traveling or working should be the only reason for people learning a foreign language.I do not agree with the idea in part , because learning a foreign language can not only help people travel or work ,but also broaden people's mind and stimulate them to think creatively.\
\
On the one hand, the reason for learning a foreign language is that it can expend people's minds.The advantage is that people who can use a foreign language proficiently are able to read or learn other countries' knowledge which they can benefit from. For example, people can read magazines, newspapers and books of English speaking countries with minimum effort.Therefore, it is easier for them to draw inspiration from good opinions, practical experiences and problem-solving abilities.\
\
On the other hand,  learning a foreign language could be a good reason for people to travel and work. They may exploit more work and travel possibilities if they have a foreign language skill. For empale, By visiting different countries and learning more about the world  people can discovery better job opportunities and earn higher salaries.Meanwhile, they can also appreciate beautiful sceneries and sample local mouth-watering food ,which can help them reduce stress and put them in good mood.\
\
I believe that learning a foreign language can open minds, which have a positive effect on their work and travel. People can enjoy their journey and improve work efficiency based on the profound understanding and respect related to backgrounds or cultures of other countries.For instance, they are more likely to earn a decent living or gain promotional opportunities if they gain insight into the habits or customs by learning necessary knowledge or common sense. Similarly, they can also experience other cultures first-hand rather than only taste some delicious food.\

\
Some people believe that making legals could be the only way to encourage people to recycle. I do not agree in part with the idea because environmental awareness and economic motivation can also promote to recycle , although governments should tighten general public's behavior by laws.\
\
Environmental awareness should be necessary to increase recycling. The reason is that \
it is crucial to spread the knowledge that small lifestyle change can have huge difference to environment.For example, general public should learn how to recycle waste in eco-friendly ways according to the different materials.Otherwise, many household appliances will end up in the landfill sites ,and the non-biodegradable products may pollute the soil and water.Therefore, city dwellers tend to sort out their garbage in an appropriate way.\
\
Economic motivation can also boost recycling behavior. Entrepreneurs can encourage people to recycle waste by providing economic rewarding. For example, some people can put their plastic bottles or batteries into some place where they can earn money, and they tend to develop a good habits that they can not only recycle their waste, but also collect other waste to gain money, which can boost the recycling circle.\
\
Governments can also pass some laws to increase recycle. Laws can demand people to recycle waste and forbid them to throw away the recycled products.For instance, a tax penalty can be levied on the use of disposable plastic bags, while subsidies or incentives could be provided for the use of environmentally friendly shopping bags. This measure would encourage the general public to make more sustainable choices, as they would otherwise face increased costs for less environmentally friendly options.\
\
In conclusion, it is essential to raise people's environmental awareness and boost this behavior by economic rewarding, although governments can make laws to increase recycling.\

The topic argues whether governments should spend money on railways,instead of  investing in roads. I believe it is essential to concentrate on development of railways, which can prompt economic growth and environmental protection, although roads are able to make people feel more convenient.\
\
Spending money on railways by governments is vital for economic growth. The advantage is that railways can improve traffic efficiency as a result of reducing traffic time that can increase the job opportunities and the likelihood of traveling. To be more specific, the commuting time has been reduced because of faster speed , raising work efficiency .Meanwhile, people are more likely to travel to other cities ,which means that they may spend money on accommodations, souvenirs , entertainments and transportations.By comparison, traffic congestion could be a daily occurrence if a large number of people drive their cars on the roads.\
\
\
Investing in development of railways by governments can protect our environment. The reason is that the public transportation can reduce carbon emissions.For instance, railways enable to help more people arrive their destination, which means that it can satisfy more people's requirements with the lower cost of fossil fuels .In contrast, if people are willing to drive cars, making it difficult to reduce the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming, which have a negative effect on the environment.\
\
\
On the other hand, the cost of railways' maintenance is higher. It is very expensive for governments  to ensure that railways should function well. For instance, the need for experts and facilities and spending on it will increase, and the increase in the cost of transportation discourage people from traveling.\
\
In conclusion, governments  spend money on railways can have positive effect on economy ,which can boost the economic development and protect the environment, although  the cost of transportation could be higher.\

The topics is whether parents or teachers should encourage children to make decisions by themselves.I believe it is significant for them to guide children for their development, although it is necessary to enable them to make their own decisions to some extent.\
\
On the one hand, some people argue that children may become self-fish if they are allowed to make choices by themselves.The reason is that they may not develop health habits when they grow up, because they only care about their own requirements. For example, some teenagers become greedy as they consider it necessary to follow the fashion ,making it difficult to develop a good spending habit, which means that they only care about money and possessions. Therefore, they may not contribute to the society. \

On the other hand, others believe it is crucial to develop children's abilities by enabling them to make decisions for themselves. The reason lies in the fact that children need to learn how to make decision that suit them. For instance, they are able to understand their characters and discover interests. For instance, some children like to play football game with peers ,which can not only boost their self-confidence and well-being, but also encourage them to cooperate with other people.\
\
\
I believe parents or teachers need to give children guidance , and allow them to make decisions based on the right choices.Parents can buy the health food such as milk and grain and they can also pursue the toys , games or books of educational value, which are beneficial to children's development. Meanwhile, if children can tell right from wrong, they should be allowed to make decisions. For instance, they are able to play games that make them more interest and inspire to think creatively rather than play video games that prompt violent .\

The topic argues that whether or not the money should be spent on building new railway lines to improve transportation efficiency between different cities.I believe that it depends upon the requirements of potential economic development.\
\
Some people believe that building fast railway lines can improve transportation efficiency. The benefit is that people are more likely to travel as a result of reduced traffic time.For example,  commuters find it easier to travel to and from work as the commuting time has been decreased. By comparison, if they only focus on improving existing pubic transport , which may not satisfy their requirements for traveling and work because of the lower speed.\
\
Other people hold the opinion that improving existing public transport can save money.The reason is that they can reuse their design and guideline about route, which city dwellers get familiar with the public transport.For instance, existing public transport can undergo reconstruction or renovation, while people can enjoy the improvement of buses or subway, which can reduce the cost of investment and improve transportation efficiency. In contrast, it is expensive to spend large sums of money to build new railway lines ,because it may raise the cost of transportation.\
\
I believe that it is necessary to evaluate whether or not it is beneficial to the economic development. If building new railway lines can boost the economic growth, it is worthy to build it. For instance, people are willing to travel and work in different cities ,which is vital for the job creations, making it easier to earn a decent living because of the travelling and work opportunities.Meanwhile, if some cities do not have enough potential economic motivation, they may improve existing public transport. For instance,  while some small cities are lower densely populated , it is wise to improve original public transport rather than building new railway lines.\

\
Nowadays, some countries have a large number of teenagers, compared with the number of elderly people. I believe that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, because it is easier to boost the development of economy and technology.\
\
One benefit is that young people are more likely to promote the work efficiency. Countries' profit rely on a supply of young workers, boosting the better services.For example, Young people are able to work more efficiency or even work overtime, so companies can  produce valuable services or products, and extend profit margin. By comparison,  the decrease in the work efficiency provided by older people is a result of cognitive decline.\
\
Another benefit is that young people can boost the economic development.The reason is that teenagers consider it necessary to follow the latest fashion, increasing the sales of products.For instance, many young people are willing to buy the latest mobile phones with up-to-date features , and replace the old ones away, which is vital for the economic growth and job opportunities. In contrast, older people are more likely love the products that are simple but practical as a result of lower consuming willings.\
\
On the other hand, older people can benefit social development.The experiences and skills of older people are beneficial to companies and society. For example, they can impart the management knowledge to the next generation. In addition, they are able to play a good moral role model for young people. \
\
In conclusion, energetic young people can boost the economic and technological development, although older people can also contribute to society or companies by their experiences. \

\
The topic argues that whether people should share information around different fields.I believe that people can share information ,while it is important to ensure that these information may not have negative effect.\
\
On the one hand, sharing information can prompt social development that many people can benefit from. The advantages of sharing information are that it can expend horizon and stimulate people to think creatively, accelerating the progress of technological innovation and economic development. For example, developed countries can share their information about science, business and the academic .Therefore, It will improve work efficiency and enhance the standard of living of developing countries, while they are able to reduce the cost of production and generate huge profit.\
\
On the other hand, some information should be preserved for significance. The reason is that it is crucial to protect these information , boosting technological development and keeping a stable society.For instance, some organizations spend much money and time on researching new skills, and they may  face with difficulty situations if outcome are shared. To be specific, nuclear weapon could have destructive effect on world ,while companies competitive will lose if their business information are shared.\
\
I believe that people can share information in cases it may not have adverse effect. It is necessary to share the knowledge or skills that are beneficial to society. For example, new energy resources can reduce the carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Moreover, the electronic vehicles can cut down on the use of fossil fuels and prevent the global warming, if the technology of electronic batteries could be shared.By comparison, some dangerous technology should be limited or even banned. For instance, business secret should be preserved for profit and military technology will not be disseminated due to the fact that it is able to hurt people.\

\
Nowadays, many people find it hard to meet their food requirements, although the agriculture has developed. It is important to figure out the reason why this phenomenon can happen and take methods to alleviate the problem.\
\
One reason is that the technology and invention of food are controlled by minority developed countries, which may not benefit all people who stay hungry around the world. For example, there are  several countries where they are able to decide the price of food.Moreover, they tend to make larger profit by increasing the prices of grain.As a result, other countries find it expensive to import the main food, leading to lack of food supply.\
\
Another reason is that many countries are not suitable for producing main food around the world.For example, there are some factors ,leading to difficult in cultivating main food. To be specific, some African countries' temperature is too high because they are located in the desert, and they  lack essential water to irrigate and do not have enough land to grow agricultural plant. In addition, these kinds of developing countries have a higher rates of birth. Therefore, many people may not gain enough food.\
\
There are two solutions to the problem. First of all, countries need to develop their agriculture technology if their amount of main food cannot meet the basic requirements.For instance, countries in the African need to learn how to cultivate food, such as the nutritional fluid can satisfy the needs of agriculture plants, although their land may not have enough soil and water. Secondly, the main countries who are good at growing food can provide money or main food for these countries. For example, importing main food from other countries can help them mitigate their hungry issues. In conclusion, by learning agricultural technologies and offering main food from other countries, this problem can be addressed to some extent.\

\
The topic argues that whether history is more important than natural subjects like science and technology.I believe both of them are important.\
\
On the one hand, history is a key part of cultural heritage. The benefit of learning history can help students understand cultures by historical events. It is important for students to gain insight into the different dynasties or progress of social development especially in their countries, making it easier for them to learn more about customs and traditional festivals.For example, understanding and celebrating traditional festivals by ceremonies can unite people and raise their national pride, resulting in the increasing the social cohesion. Therefore, they are likely to respect traditional cultures and avoid the demise of it.\
\
On the other hand, natural subjects can boost social development. The reason is that science and technology can promote the efficiency of work force, and the massive produce may reduce the cost of living as a result of technological innovation that can boost the economic development, if students are able to have a grasp of  knowledge and experience of these core disciplines. For example, many electronic devices such as mobile phone and laptops can be sold at a low price, making it possible for people to buy a broad range of products.By this way,  the highly consumer societies may meet people's requirements as they enjoy a large number of choices.\
\
In my opinion, it is rational to focus on natural  and social science. Students can design better products or services by the knowledge of science and technology , if they are able to deeply understand the customs ,cultures and even religions of consumers ,who could be potential customers.\

The topic argues that there are too many choices in modern city , and I agree in part with this idea that it may have some negative effects on individuals' life .

\f2 \
\
It is difficult for people to achieve their common goal because of different choices.The reason is that they are likely to experience different matters, which may  distract people's attention. For example, individuals tend to have a varied careers , and their work efficiency may not meet the requirements of marketing and employers as a result of shorter working experience, leading to lower salaries and limited career advancement. Therefore, they find it hard to become an expert at a field of work and have a successful career.\
\
Too many choices may increase people's cost of living. The reason lies the fact that they are obsessed with how to make decisions in their daily life. For example, there are many advertisements which disseminate a large number of commercial information in different platforms such as TV and the Internet. As a result, people who are overwhelm by it have to spend much time analyzing whether these products prompted by advertisement can satisfy their needs, leading to higher cost of thinking in their lives.\
\
On the other hand, choices may give people more freedom to meet their preferences. People may have a wide range of requirements because of different factors, such as sex, age and hobby. For instance, people may choose the products or services that suit them, which may boost well-being and increase confidence.\
\
In conclusion,  I believe that too many choices make people feel puzzled , although it can provide more freedom to choose.\

The topic argues that people who live in a country where they have to speak a foreign language may lead to serious issues, such as social and practical problems. I disagree in part with the idea that they may experience  serious problems , although they have to adapt to new lifestyles in international settings.\
\
People who live in foreign countries may open their minds in the social environment that different cultures are recommended. The reason lies the fact that exposure to diversity cultures can help people draw inspiration from opinions and lifestyles, which they may limited by their own habits. For example, some people who used to live in developing countries with rigid hierarchy rules may have a sense of freedom, if they move to developed countries where they support the social equality. Therefore, they will feel motivated, making it easier for them to integrate into the foreign society, instead of leading to serious problems.\
\
People can also get more practical experiences and opportunities for their personal development in other countries.The reason is that they may find better jobs and get the tertiary educational qualifications. For example, many developed countries concentrate on city dwellers' welfare services, which can provide free education to help disadvantaged students in schooling and offer the jobs that they can earn higher salaries and gain promotional opportunities. As a result, they can develop their practical abilities and have a descent quality of lives that break the poverty circle.\
\
On the other hand, it is crucial to acknowledge that people who live in the foreign countries may cope with some unexpected situations. They have to overcome the language barriers and bridge the potential divides associated with economy and politics. For instance, they find it difficult to adapt to some new ways of living and communicate ideas with local inhabitants. They have to spend much time and energy to change their original thinkings and behaviors ,which helps them suit foreign countries.\
\
In conclusion, I believe people who live in foreign countries can receive diversity social cultures and develop practical experiences, although they need to make some positive changes.\

The topic argues that many people prefer to be self-employed, instead of working for a company and organization. It is essential to understand the reasons and discuss the negative effects on it.\
\
There are two reasons why people love to be self-employed .First of all, they can earn higher salaries in this way than working for a company. For example, they can write some articles or take photos ,which can be published on the Internet that can make money, if potential consumers , such as readers or expresses ,pay for it.Therefore, they are able to raise their salaries by personnel effort, rather than following companies' rules.What's more, some people have introvert character as they are unwilling to communicate ideas with other people.The development of information technology make it possible for them to work from home or some places where they can avoid the face-to-face  interaction. For instance, they can complete their work independently that satisfy the marketing requirements and make a living.\
\
One disadvantage of self-employed is that it may increase the cost of regulation. The reason is that it is difficult for governments to regulate this kind of economic behavior. For example, authorities find it hard to censor some articles or photos disseminated by someone and judge  whether they obey the laws, if  governments need to regulate this behavior. Unlike an organization that governments can negotiate with them directly, while they need to analyze the  publisher and their purposes by their articles or photos , which can cost their time and energy.\
\
Another negative effect is that the pace of technological development will be slowed down as many people love to be self-employed. The reason lies the fact that some technological departments require a large number of talents. For example,  aviation sectors need to recruit many employees who learn different core disciplines ,including chemistry or physics, if they are addicted to their personal profit or preferences ,the development of technology will lag behind. \
\
\
In conclusion, the reasons for people who choose to be self-employed are results of their personal rewarding and characters, which may increase the cost of regulation and have a negative effect on technological development.\

The topic argues that music can bring people from diverse cultures and ages together. I disagree in part with the idea that music may not achieve the common goal, although people can have the similar feelings.\
\
The spread of music may not overcome the cultural barriers, when people hear the same music. The reason is that people are not able to know the meaning of a music without essential cultural backgrounds. For example, people find it difficult to understand the story and psychological state associated with a music , if they do not used to read relevant materials. Therefore, they are obsessed with the meaning of the music disseminating, instead of appreciating the perception of beautiful music. \
\
People from diverse ages may not  have the same hobby when they listen a music.The reason lies the fact that the preferences of music varies across ages. For example, older people are more likely to listen some classical music that is famous for a long time , while teenagers love the popular music that can reflect the current character. As a result, one type of  music cannot satisfy people from diverse ages.\
\
On the other hand, music can give people the similar feelings to some extent. Human have the resemble feelings, such as happy and salad. For instance, when they listen some enjoyable music , they may feel motivated.\
\
In conclusion, I do not believe that music can bring people together from diverse backgrounds related to different cultures and ages, although people may have the similar feelings when they listen to it.\

The topic argues that whether the main environmental problem is only related to the loss of some plants or animals. I believe that people need to concentrate on some radical environmental problems ,although we should preserve the wild plants or animals.\
\
On the one hand,  some particulars species of  plants and animals which experience dangerous situation may have adverse effect on people's living condition . The reason is that some wild life are key part of our eco-system that we live in. For example, some plants and animals ,such as pandas and tigers, have been threaten because of the illegal hunting and environmental pollution.Therefore , the degradation of forest are attributed to the human activities ,which may interrupt the natural balance, leading to abnormal weather phenomenon, which damage the environment that we rely on.\
\
On the other hand, people may damage the environment because of their life style, which may  lead to the more serious environmental problems. The reason lies the fact that people do not have environmental awareness. For example, massive product allow people to purse a broaden range of products , leading to excessive consumption, cause pollution as well as waste. What is more, these household appliances or some disposable items will end up in landfill sites, and the non-biodegradable products have destructive effects on the soil and water.Therefore, environmental issues become increasing detrimental. \
\
In my opinion, people need to change their lifestyles which can have negative impact on the environment, although the wild life should be protected. The development of industry that form public's lifestyles and damaged the environment result in died out of some wild life. Governments and  environmental groups should concentrate on the root causes, including the raising environmental awareness and promoting the recycling, which can help create a pleasant environment , which can also build a better habitat for wild life.\

\
\
This topic argues that whether people need to accept a bad situation  , or they should try their best to improve situations. I believe that  people are able to make their situations better before they can understand the reasons for the unsatisfactory situations that they live in .\
\
One opinion is that people should accept a situation that may not meet their requirements. The reason is that people need to keep adaptable to the adverse environment that is out of their control, which is very important in the real life. For example, economic recession forces some companies to cut their salaries to reduce spending on the employees, so graduate students find it difficult to have a decent living ,even though they worked hard to obtain the tertiary education qualifications under the increasing pressure because of a climbing unemployment rate due to the fact that many companies are unlikely to recruit new employees as the uncertainty about the economic outlook.By comparison, if they are not able to adapt to the adverse situation, they may feel frustrated , leading to some bad behaviors , such as criminal offense or even the suicide.\
\
Another view is that people should try to improve their situations that can satisfy their needs.The reason lies the fact that they should take actions to increase their knowledge and abilities to enjoy good situations. For example, teenagers should upgrade their practical experience or reevaluate their career goal by educational and vocational training to achieve the expectation of their employers who concentrate on the individuals bring skills and knowledge to their organizations. Therefore, they can earn higher salaries or gain promotional opportunities from their companies.\
\
In my opinion, people should  try their best to improve their situations related to their work or living conditions before they are able to accept the bad situations that they have to confront with. People should understand the root causes of the situations, and consider whether they can improve their cases by discovering the existence problems that they should solve. For instance, The ability to increase their competitive edge for making more profit become increasingly important for many people, including communication skills, foreign languages skill, when their job may not meet their requirements.\
\
\
\
This topic argue that children are told that they can achieve any targets as long as they can try their best. I agree in part this idea, although children should also consider some objective conditions.\
\
Children who are inspired to to do their best for their requirements can help them find their talents. The reason lies the fact that children are more likely to exploit their interests ,which can improve their imagination and make them more creative. For example, children are willing to spend much time for their advantages under inspiration and guidance from their parents and teachers , such as arts, science and sports. Therefore, they will develop good habits to have a grasp of rules or principles, and it is easier to have a better academic performance and become experts at a field of work when they grow up.\
\
Children who are encouraged to achieve their common goal by their hard-work can improve their problem-solving abilities. The reason is that children who are motivated by their parents and teachers are able to cope with unexpected problems because of their increasing confidence. For example,  they can not only use some rules to solve some problems , but also discovery new methods and theories to improve their study or work efficiency , such as homework and housework. Therefore, they can solve some problems in different ways by themselves rather than rely heavily on their parents or teachers.\
\
On the other hand, children may fail to achieve their goal by trying hard.They may not analyzes some objective conditions which are needed to support their target. For instance, they may find it difficult to nurture the plants if they ignore some factors such as soil, water and temperature. They may feel frustrated and depressed.\
\
In conclusion, I believe that there are some advantages for children who are inspired to try  something with hard working, including discovering their talents and boosting their  problem-solving abilities ,while parents and teachers should remind them to  consider some objective factors and conditions.\

\
\
This topic argue that whether advertising can promote people to buy things. I believe advertising can encourage people to buy products , if it can consider some essential factors , such as  advertising design and requirements of consumers.\
\
On the one hand, some people believe that advertising can encourage people to buy products.The reason lies the fact that  advertising can provide consumers with options available, when they do not have knowledge about the products which they want. For example, parents can purchase the best products such as books, toys and games of educational value  prompted by advertising , which can benefit their development of children. \
\
On the other hand, other people think that there are too many advertisements which may not attract people's attention for sailing. The reason is that a large number of advertisements are very distracting, especially when it tries to convey messages by different brands.For example, consumers are obsessed with how to make a decision related to one product prompted by varied advertisements advocating different brands in different channels, and they find it difficult to identify whether the products can satisfy their needs by advertisements advocating in a short time.\
\
In my opinion,  advertising can boost the sales of products, provided that it can be designed to give an impressive influence on consumers and meet their requirements.It is important for advertising to consider whether their products can have competitive edge in the market, such as technological innovation and perception of beauty directed at special consumers. What is more, the advertising should be designed to be more creative since an eye-catching advertising can attract many people's attention, which can add the number of potential consumers.\

People will not buy printed books or newspapers as they can read information online without paying. I agree in part with the idea ,although some people may still to read printed materials.\
\
Reading online can benefit people in economic term. The reason is that they will not need to pay for it. For example, many people can learn and read blogs, news and fictions offered by apps and websites. By comparison, producing books or newspapers requires a series of processes, including printing , transporting and sailing, which may increase the cost of reading.By reading online, they can expend their horizons without considering the prices of books or newspapers.\
\
Reading online can also give people a sense of convenience. The reason lies the fact that people will be able to read anything online without carrying printed materials. For example, they can use their mobile phone or laptop connecting internet to search any information they need , making it easier to carry around than books or newspapers, which can save their time and energy. Therefore, they can search internet for anything they want conveniently.\
\
On the other hand, some people may prefer to read printed books or newspapers due to their reading habits. It is easier for them to find books they like and take notes on it. For example,  they can write their opinions and views on the page as a foster of accomplishments ,especially when they read these books repeatedly without relying on the internet which may damage their health, such as the adverse effect on their eyesight.\
\
In conclusion, with the increasing number of people reading what they need online , people are unlikely to buy printed books or newspapers due to reading cost and carrying easily, although some people may maintain their habit of reading printed materials.\

<own a home important rent one>\
\
People concentrate on owning a home rather than renting one in some countries. I believe that it is a positive situation and needs to analyze reasons for this phenomenon.\
\
There are some reasons for this phenomenon. To start with, owning a home can give people a sense of belong, which means that they do not need to move to other places where they are not familiar with and enjoy advantages of policies which governments provided, especially when they want to marriage with their lover and have babies.Secondly, governments encourage people to buy houses by loaning, which is vital for economic growth and job creations.\
\
One advantage of owning a home is that people can enjoy local well-fare provided by policies The reason is lies the fact that governments make some positive different policies across ages. For example, individuals who buy a home can gain retirement revenue and medical care when they arrive the statutory retirement age, and their babies can enter into better schools. \
\
Another advantage is that an increasing number of people buying house can boost economic growth. The reason is that many people will loan for their houses in a long term, which means that more and more people prefer to live there for a long time, where are densely populated, so this place can offer more job opportunities , making it easier for people to have a decent quality of their lives. For example, ambitious, energetic ,hardworking individuals with creative ideas move to one cities can create and satisfy a wide range of requirements. Therefore, economy will develop faster in this place.\
\
On the other hand, owning a home may impose a heavy economic burden on people. People struggle to confront with the financial problems due to their loan. For instance, they have to work hard and save money to pay back , which may increase the risks of their psychological and physical health.\
\
In conclusion, people give priority to  own a home because they can enjoy governments policies such as well-fare services and it is good for economic growth, although they should consider their pressure, which may have adverse effect on their health.\

\
People will become passengers because of the driverless in the coming years.I believe the disadvantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the advantages.\
\
Driverless vehicle's may have negative effect on the economic growth. The reason is that the facilities of driverless require governments and companies to pour much money into the transportation systems for maintaining. For example, driverless vehicles not only demand companies to research vehicles supported by artificial intelligence but also force governments to allocate money to build a series of facilities, such as road , traffic lights and even the internet services ,which can meet the driverless vehicles needs. Therefore, the cost of transportation will function in a high cost level, which may damage the economic growth.\
\
People may not have a happy life because of driverless vehicles. The reason lies the fact that many people believe they deserve the freedom to drive by themselves, which is important to the real life. For example, some people may prefer to enjoy the faster speed , which can save the time and boost the efficiency or help reduce their stress and relax, because they can control the vehicles by their ways.\
\
On the other hand, driverless vehicles can help avoid some traffic problems caused by people. Driverless vehicle's can operate well for a long time and may not lose control. For example, it can obey traffic laws and drive in an adaptable speed, which can save people's life. Conversely, traffic accident and congestion always happen due to disobeying traffic laws and tired driving by people, leading to losing their control and hurting other people because of these factors. \
\
In conclusion, I argue that it is unnecessary to deprive people of opportunities to drive , although driverless vehicles can help people avoid some traffic problems\

Many food which contain too much sugar may have adverse effect on people's health. I believe  it is possible to raise the price of sugar , which can prevent people from consuming it.\
\
People are unwilling to buy food containing high levels of sugar , if its price can be made more expensive. The reason lies the fact that the raising price of sugar can lead to an increase in cost of living. For example, people are less likely to choose the food and drink ,such as hamburger and pizzas, which contain sugar because of the expensive ingredient. \
\
Entrepreneurs tend to product some alternative ingredient to sugar for attracting people's attention by lower cost and advantage of health. The reason is that businesses have to keep agile and adaptable to the changing market trend and consumer preferences. For example, food and drink companies can research some new ingredient which can satisfy the waste of consumers  and improve their health.\
\
On the other hand, it is necessary to improve people's health awareness rather than only concentrate on the price of sugar. People who rely heavily on sugar may not change their eating habits with increasing cost of sugar. For example, some people without health awareness can also afford to buy food and drink containing much sugar , but if the governments or health groups can disseminate knowledge about the importance of less sugar , making it easier to guide people to eat food and drink containing less sugar.\
\
In conclusion,  sugary products can discourage people from consuming much sugar, although healthy awareness should also be considered.\

The plans show the changing of an airport redeveloped in the next year.\
\
The airport contains arrival and departure areas. Arrival areas add some new facilities, including cafe restaurant, ATM and car hire, which can support people to have a rest ,withdraw money and hire cars. In the departure areas, people can buy something in shops which will be projected to add to meet customers' needs. Cafe restaurant is expected to shift from the eastern-north corner to the western-south corner. Meanwhile, the location of check-in is projected to shift from west to east, while a bag drop will be added to replace it.\
\
New planning add more gates and add new facilities to make people feel convenience.The number of gates will increase from eight to eighteen, which the area is expected to expend. What is more,  sky train will be built to improve customer's effeciency replacing walkway.\
\
Overall, the southwest airport will be expended and add more gates or facilities to improve consumers' convenience and efficiency, which can attract more people to enjoy their services.\

Nowadays, many entrepreneurs give priority to the new characters of products by advertising. I believe that it has a positive effect on their development, although it may present some challenges to these companies.\
\
Companies that disseminate their new characters related to their products by advertisements can boost high-profit margin. The reason lies the fact that they can discover consumers' potential needs which can help them keep agile and adaptable to changing markets trend and consumers' preferences. For example, if a company who produce running shoes can add some energetic factors by advertising ,which can make an eye-catching product. Therefore, it can attract more teenagers to pay attention to it and prefer to pursue this kind of shoes which can symbolize as a unique character, which means that it can increase the sales of products , leading to an ideal financial outcome. \
\
Businesses that concentrate on new characters of products by advertisement can prompt the development of technology. The reason is that  business environment is turbulent , and even a well-established company can be shutdown overnight, which prompt these  companies to cope with fierce competition by technological innovation. For instance, many people prefer to buy the latest mobile phones with up-to-date features, and some mobile phone companies struggle to develop new functions and spread it by advertising.The consequence is that they can maintain their the share of marketing by prompting technological development.\
\
On the other hand, businesses may be affected adversely, if they give an exaggerated account of new characters by advertising. For example, some businesses urgent to make profit and fraud consumers, leading to breaking the laws and poor reputation.\
\
In conclusion, I argue that businesses that concentrate on their new characters of products by advertisement can prompt development of technology and high-profit margin, although they should ensure that advertisements are consist with their products.\

Increasing number of people in some countries tend to research the history of their living place.There are some reasons for this phenomenon such as culture and lifestyle, and it is important to find some useful ways which can help people understand the history.\
\
There are two reasons for people who are interested in discovered about the history of their house or building. First of all, people prefer to understand the culture related to the place. For example, they are likely to know the style of design which can manifest people's waste of culture. Next, they intend to get familiar with the lifestyles or habits in the past, which their ancestors used to have. For instance, they are willing to realize the functions of the divided rooms and learn how to use it reasonably.\
\
There are two measures which can help people research the history of their house or building. People can learn more about history of living place by researching some architecture knowledge. The reason is that people can learn the culture about it. For example ,they can find the planning about their living place, which can understand the designed purpose of their building or house. What's more, they can study some knowledge about art works , such as sculptures, statues and paintings, which can reflected people's perception of beautify in the special episode. \
\
Another method which can help people learn the history of their living place is interview. This is a better way to learn about the ways of life related to the place in the past by communicating with elderly people. For instance, Some older people are able to help know about how their ancestors lived in different rooms, including work , enjoying their leisure time and sleep. Therefore, contemporary will not be restricted by their current time, and deepen understanding about the history of their living place.\
\
In conclusion , more and more people intend to learn about the history of their living place , such as the knowledge of architecture and lifestyles, so they can understand this by researching the design of buildings and interviewing some older people.\

This topic discuss about whether people should take risks , both in professional lives and personal lives. I believe taking risks have advantages outweigh the disadvantages ,although people should consider the cost of risks.\
\
Some people who take risks at the field of their profession can boost the economic growth. The reason lies the fact that taking risks can make employees more creativity.For example, running an organization is a daunting task, and the business environment is turbulent. Companies can make a huge profit if they encourage employees to break the mould, such as investment in improvement of new products which can keep agile and adaptable to the changing market and consumer preferences, meanwhile, employees can also have a sense of accomplishments because of their contribution, although it may present challenges to the companies or individuals which may take some risks about cost and time.\
\
People who can take risks in some degree can benefit their health.The reason is that they are able to expand their horizons and boost their physical abilities by challenging themselves. For example , they try to climb mountains, so they need to do some exercise regularly and some  hurts or torture are inevitable , but they gain stronger physical condition.As a result, they may draw inspiration from these behaviors and have a sense of pride and happy, which can benefit their physical and physiological health.\
\
On the other hand,  taking risks can may affect people adversely.People should also concentrate on the cost and possibilities of risks which they have to experience. For example, they may loss money by investment in some uncertain areas, such as stock and collections.They should ensure they are able to confront with these potential problems.\
\
In conclusion,  I believe taking risks can benefit organizations and individuals , although people should focus on the cost and possibilities of risks.\

Today, some children rely on smartphones every day because of the development of society , which may have a negative effect on development of children.\
\
The one reason for this trend is about fast paced lifestyle related to families . Nowadays, nuclear families are very common.The consequence is that many parents have busy life and often work overtime, which means that they do not have adequate time to company with their children, so they are not as close to their children as they used to be. For example, parents have to earn money to have a decent of quality of lives, so children have to take care of themselves, leading to an increased screen time.\
\
Another reason is that the development of technology. Smartphones are necessary for children to learn or play.For example, there are many apps or websites for children to expand horizon, so they can use these softwares developing on smartphone to learn these knowledge.What's more, they can also use smartphone to communicate with their teachers and friends.In addition, they can play video games to relax.\
\
Smartphones may have an adverse effect on children's development.The reason is that many children lack self decline. For example, many video games prompt violence, and children who are addicted to these games are increasing temperamental because they tend to copy what they see, leading to some behavioral problems and poor eye-sight.\
\
In conclusion, the trend for some children who are willing to spend time on smartphones is the result of busy lifestyle and development of technology, and there will have an adverse effect on their development , such as health and character.\

There is a topic about whether professionals should work in the country where they used to be trained. I believe they should have freedom to work in another country as long as these people offer some services or rewarding for the country where he used to learned.\
\
Some people believe that professionals should provide the country where they used to be trained with their services to stimulate economic growth.The reason lies the fact that governments need to put much money to train professional people ,who can meet  a wide range of social requirements to attract more talents in terms of accelerating the pace of development in the country.For example, engineers are able to build many high-rise buildings with modern facilities ,such as shopping centers ,libraries , city plazas, which can increase the appeal of the country. As a result, the country can train more talents and boost the economic development.  \
\
Other people argue that professionals should enjoy the freedom to work in another country where they want to satisfy their needs.The reason is that professional people may have their  own interests, including economy, cultures. For example, some people can find work in another country where they can earn higher salaries or enjoy better living conditions. Therefore, they can achieve their ideal outcomes by offering service which they made an afford to learn these professional disciplines.\
\
\
In my opinion, professionals can work in another country, provided that they should offer their services and contribute to the country where they used to learn. Training professionals require much time and money ,so these kind of people need to payback the country where they gained the useful knowledge and practical skills , and then they may choose to work for their interests.\

Today, more and more people with health problems prefer to try alternative medicines and treatments rather than visit their usual doctor. I think this is a negative development for traditional methods, although alternative methods can also be good for people's health.\
\
Alternative medicines and treatments which attract more and more people may reduce people's work and study efficiency. The reason is that alternative methods need people to spend much time and energy for their health than traditional methods. For example, many people have busy careers and often work overtime, so they do not have adequate time to rest ,leading to difficult in keeping work-life balance, while many alternative methods ,such as herbs which can solve health problems by eating or smelling, have to reduce their working or learning time which reduce their working lives efficiency. Conversely, visiting usual doctor who understand root causes of their health problems can give an effective solutions quickly, which can improve their life efficiency.\
\
Alternative medicines and treatments may have also a negative effect on development of traditional methods.The reason lies the fact that an increasing number of people who participate in alternative methods may lead to a decrease in fees of researching related to traditional methods, including medical devices ,bills and doctors' salary. For example, many people prefer to spend money on alternative medicines, which means that lower resource may put into the traditional methods. As a result, the numbers of usual doctors will decrease or even demise. \
\
On the other hand, people acknowledge that alternative medicines and treatments are beneficial to their health. The alternative methods adapts some scientific theories to prompt people's health with lower poisons. For example, herbs are kinds of food which is get closer to nature, so people can enjoy this methods without some undesirable side effects. However, when people visit usual doctor and get some pills ,they have to monitor their health status after eating it.\
\
In conclusion, I believe that more and more people who choose alternative medicines and treatments have some adverse effects about working lives efficiency and development of traditional methods, although alternative methods can also have some effects on people's health.\

Husbands and wives should share the burden of housework because both have to work all day long. I agree that women and men should share housework although they need to reconcile with each other.\
\
\
\
Couples with full- time jobs will have more connections because they may spend similar energy and time ,so they should share housework tasks equally. Many nuclear families have a busy career and often work over time , and they may feel frustrated if they have to deal with housework alone . For example, when they return home, they will have to deal with many household chores such as washing clothes and cooking.As a result, they will be highly dependent on each other if they can share these tasks equally, especially those who can carry out household chores that they are good at, and their family ties will be increased.\
\
\
\
Couples can improve their financial situation if both can share housework tasks equally.If they can balance their work with housework tasks fairly, they both have more self-confidence and a good mood to deal with work and achieve their career goals. For example , couples who can handle housework tasks better ,which means they can have a harmonious life, so they can absorb energy and courage from family. As a result, they can concentrate on their careers and make an effort to earn a decent living under their coordination.\
\
\
\
On the other hand, they should help others who may face unexpected situations. When their wife or husband feels sick, their partner should take on the burden of housework, so they need to reconcile with each other, rather than give up their responsibilities .\
\
\
\
In conclusion, full- time couples should share work equally, which is good for their relationships and financial situation ,although they should take care of some unexpected situations.\

Some people argue that they prefer to live in a horizontal city with few tall buildings, while others hold the opposite view. I agree that vertical cities are more beneficial to people than horizontal cities.\
\
Vertical buildings are more environmentally friendly than horizontal buildings. The reason is that this kind of buildings can use land effectively, which may reduce the destruction of environment.For example, high-rise buildings will occupy less land ,but they can offer more modern services and rooms for people ,including elevators, central air conditioning and 24-hour security.By contrast, horizontal buildings such as apartment blocks will be built on more land , meaning wild animals and plants will be threatened or even killed ,making it difficult to maintain balance between humans and nature.\
\
In addition, vertical buildings can also boost economic growth.High-rise buildings can not only provide workplaces, but also become tourist spots to attract tourists to visit. For example , skyscrapers can support many people in setting up their new businesses ,which can increase the number of employees . What\'92s more, many tourists prefer to visit the top of skyscraper to enjoy the sightseeing on it and spend money on accommodations, entertainments or souvenirs.\
\
On the other hand, it is difficult for vertical buildings to function well . People may find it difficult to manage because of their altitude. For example ,it is not easy to keep high-rise buildings clean or maintain normal operations ,which require more money and energy than horizontal buildings.\
\
In conclusion , I argue that vertical buildings can boost the economy and be more eco-friendly ,although they need to be managed .\
\
owth by suggesting that people recycle waste. Recycling policy can bring tangible benefits to city dwellers.For example, governments can encourage people to pick up their salaries surrounded by their local communities ,and people can earn money from their salaries that can be recycled.Meanwhile, garbage collection companies can recycle waste faster .\
\
\
On the other hand, people may live under pressure to give priority to their local environment.They may not have enough time to rest because they have to allocate energy and time for it. They may feel frustrated , while this requirement may limit their lives.\
\
In conclusion, I believe that governments that encourage people to take care of their environment can improve the efficiency of environmental protection and boost economic growth , although people have to spend some time and energy to be responsible for it.\
\
There is a question about whether people can build buildings like homes or offices the way they like ,including design and construction.I think the disadvantages are more visible than the benefits.\
\
Work efficiency may be adversely affected if people design or construct their office buildings as they please. Office buildings should follow some basic rules to design to meet business requirements, such as public workplaces. For example, there should be central air conditioning , elevators and some facilities to save people from fires and earthquakes.By contrast, if office buildings are designed or constructed without these factors in mind, office workers find it difficult to work in a normal way , so they may feel frustrated ,leading to a reduction in work efficiency.\
\
People may not feel comfortable building homes that only consider their interests. The reason is that they should not only focus on their own interests but also take care of the feelings of their neighbors. For example, several families may share public facilities ,such as green spaces, water or electricity grids, so they also need to follow basic rules.By contrast, if someone occupies public space or affects their neighbors negatively, their relationship will collapse and they may not have a happy life.\
\
On the other hand, some innovation can be encouraged if these buildings follow basic rules or laws when they are designed or constructed. For example ,some new technology can be applied to save energy ,or some buildings are designed to include some future factors that can help people reduce stress.\
\
\
In conclusion, I do not believe that people should build homes or office buildings without restrictions by some basic rules or laws, although some innovation can be encouraged.\
\

The topic is that whether the aim of science should concentrate on improving people's standard of living. I believe that science should give priority to this aspect.\
\
Science that concentrate on improving people's lives can make a fair society. The reason is that technological progress ,including massive-produced and technological innovation, make it possible for people to pursuit many goods which they want because of reducing cost of living. For example, many electronic devices , such as mobile-phones and laptops, can be sold at a low price, so poverty people in particular, can afford the latest products with up-to-date features and enjoy the rewarding by information episode. As a result, science can help make a fair society.\
\
Science that direct on improving people's lives can make a happy society which can take care of disadvantaged people.The reason lies the fact that  the development of technology can help savage disadvantaged people from diseases , which may bring a wide range of tortures to them. For example, some older people are obsessed with many illnesses , such as headache and toothache, so science can resolve or alleviate their problems, and they can live a more healthy life and their life expectancy will be increased.Therefore, our society will become happier.\
\
On the other hand, science can also discover the truth around the world or even the cosmetics. It allows people to understand many principles or rules in nature, which can help people understand some phenomenon that they used to find it hard to explain. For example, people can learn more about the knowledge related to the origin of lives.\
\
In conclusion, I believe that science should give priority to people's lives which can make a fair and happy society, although it can also be used to discover some rules or principles.\

There is an argue that whether university students should concentrate on main subjects. I believe that it is essential for students to learn core subjects well , although they can also learn other disciplines if they can gain qualification.\
\
On the one hand, some people believe university students who are dedicated to their core disciplines for qualification can find job easily. The reason is that entrepreneurs prefer to give more opportunities for those students who gain qualification. For example, students who gain qualification related to engineers can build model to analyze data, who are more likely to achieve requirements of companies where they can improve productivity and reduce cost.  As a result, they can have a decent quality of their lives.\
\
On the other hand, others hold the opinion that students who learn other subjects apart from main subjects are beneficial to development of society. The reason lies the fact that students who have a sense of social responsibilities can make for a fair and happy society ,so they may not only live an independent live by their abilities but also contribute to society after graduation as soon as they can. For example, they can help disadvantaged students or some older people if they learn some knowledge about moral principle . Conversely, they are addicted to their interest and become self-fish or greedy ,who may even break laws.\
\
In my opinion, university students can also learn other subjects if they can gain qualification. They can find job easily by qualification , meanwhile, they can also exploit other interests and make effort to contribute to society. For example, they are more likely to earn money when they gain tertiary educational qualification. What's more, they are willing to discovery other interests to relax or recharge batteries and donate money to help other people who need to be helped by learning other disciplines.\

Nowadays, many people prefer to transfer from countryside to cities, leading to a decrease in number of people living in rural areas.I believe that this trend has a positive effect on social development .\
\
\
People from rural areas can improve their standard of living when they move to cities.The reason lies in the fact that  there are many requirements in cities where can provide a broad range of study or job opportunities because of large number of citizens. For example, they can study in cities to break poverty circle and find better jobs which they can earn higher salaries or gain promotion opportunities. Therefore, they can make a decent living by themselves.\
\
With increasing number of rural people moving to cities, the development of cities will be prompted.The reason is that ambitious, energetic and hardworking individuals with creative ideas can make a good use of their talent and varied abilities to accelerate development of cities.For example, different kinds of people who work as engineers ,doctors or drivers can make an effort to devote their time and energy to contribute to society.As a result, Cities can develop in many terms such as economy, culture and technology.\
\
\
On the other hand, people living in countryside find it difficult to revitalize local economy.  The shortage of workforce may lead to problems. For example, the number of extend families or nuclear families will decrease for a long time, which may have negative effects on the countryside economy.\
\
In conclusion, I believe people who move  from rural area to cities are beneficial to development of cities and their standard of living, although it may affect adversely on countryside.\

With increasing number of elderly people living longer than the past .Some people think this phenomena may bring problems for governments ,while others argue that elderly people are beneficial to society. I believe that elderly people may have some negative effects on society.\
\
Social welfare services will be affected adversely if governments have to concentrate on healthcare of elderly people living longer.The reason is that the need for medical care and spending on it tend to increase because of aging population, which can not only present challenges to hospital facilities but also impose burden on tax payers. For example, it is easier for elderly people to have some healthy problems such as asthma or fever, so government are forced to spend fundings on facilities and offer financial support for them.By comparison, other welfare services, including education and technology, will show a decrease trend in the future.As a result, governments find it difficult to keep balance elderly healthcare services with other essential services.\
\
The increasing number of elderly people participating in the work may have negative effect on the economic development.Because of cognitive decline,  elderly people find it hard to follow the fast-paced of lifestyle, which means they have lower productivity than teenagers.For example, they may feel tired  and frustrated to insist to work for a long time, especially those work requesting people to have a strong physical conditions such as driving or packaging. Therefore, social economical development will decrease as a whole.\
\
On the other hand, elderly people are also beneficial to the the society. Many elderly people have more life experience and have a higher sense of responsibility.For example, they can teach practical skills and good manners to young people , such as management skills or politeness. They can play a good role model for young people who should learn and obey rules and have some good habits.\
\
In conclusion, I argue that elderly people living longer may have some adverse effects on economic development or healthcare system, although their experience can help young people to learn.\

The table shows information about the subway systems in six cities.\
\
There were three countries where it took over half of million people in average year. London was the first country where it was opened in 1863 and had 394 kilometers, and 775 millions people took it per year.Paris was the second country where the opening date was 1900 and had 199 kilometers, and 1191 millions people took it per year.Tokyo was the third country where it was opened in 1927 and had 155 kilometers, and 1927 millions people took it per year.\
\
The other countries' people are unlikely to take subway, although  they developed the underground railway systems. Washington DC opened the subway in 1976, and the length of it was only 126 kilometers, while the number of people who took it were about 144 millions every year. Kyoto had the lowest length of subway(11 kilometers), which was built in 1981 and 45 millions of people took it every year. In the 21st century, Los Angeles built the subway in 2001, which had 28 kilometers and the number of people who took it was about 50 millions.\
\
Overall, the capital of different countries were more likely to build the subway, which will be built in earlier time, and had the higher kilometers that serve more people.\

The map show the planning related to two possible sites for building supermarket.\
\
The first possibilities(S1) is that the supermarket are required to serve two cities, which will be located in the west-north of Garlsdon that next to Hindon, and it can attract both cities' dwellers that population is about 75,000.There will have two ways that inhabitants are able to arrive, so people from Hindon and Garlsdon can purchase the products by taking railway or driving cars, although it will be estrange from both town centers.\
\
The second design(S2) is that the supermarket will serve Garlsdon, Bransdon and Cransdon, which will be located in the town centre that are surrounded by housing. There are three ways for people to arrive. To be more specific, a railway that can provide dwellers from other cities'  such as Hindon and Cransdon  with opportunities to buy some products they need, and two main roads which is convenient for people living in Bransdon and Cransdon.\
\
Overall, the first possibilities will serve two cities, including Garlsdon and Hindon. The secondary is expected to offer service for three cities such as  Garlsdon, Bransdon and Cransdon. \

The diagrams show the different reasons for study among students that varies across groups of ages and the rate of support they received from employers. \
\
With age, more and more students tended to learn for interest. 80% of students under 26 studied for career and the data for interest was 10%.70% of  students between 26-29 studied for career and the data for interest was 22%.55% of  students between 30-39 studied for career and the data for interest was 22%.40% of students between 40-49  studied for career and interest. 20% of  students over 49  studied for career and the data for interest was 70%.\
\
Employers were more likely to support young people for learning. 70% of employers encouraged employees under 26 to study.50% of  employers encouraged employees between 26-29 to study.30% of  employers encouraged employees between 30-39 to study.35% of  employers encouraged employees between 40-49  to study.40% of  employers encouraged employees over 49 to study.\
\
Overall, young people were more likely to learn for career ,while older people had the tendency to learn for interest. At the same time, employers were willing to provide young people with fees for studying.\

The figure for Sweden in the percentage of people aged over 65 saw an upward trend from 6% in 1940 to 20% in 2010, and it is expected to increase to over 25% in 2040. Meanwhile, the figure for USA in the percentage of people aged over 65 grew from 9% in 1940 to 15% in 1980 and stayed the same level until 2018, and it will dramatically climb to 23% in 2040.\
\
In Asia, The figure for Japan show a fluctuating trend. In 1940, the figure for Japan decreased from 5 in 1940 to about 3% in 1960 and kept the same level until 1985.However, it rosed to 10% in 2025, and it is projected to increase surprisingly to 27% in 2040.\
\
Overall, USA and Sweden will show upward trends and Japan will represent a waving trend.\

The diagrams shows the life cycle of the silkworm in different stages and represents steps in the production of silk cloth. \
\
The first diagram show the  life cycle of the silkworm. Silkworms lay eggs on the leaves, and then these eggs will be hatched in 10 days. Silkworms' larvas need to eat mulberry leaf . After 4-6 weeks larvas are able to produce silk threads , and the process will last 3-8 days. Larvas will live in cocoon that they knit and become moth by breaking cocoons after 16 days, which means that they are able to lay eggs again. \
\
The second diagram show the  production of silk cloth.The cocoons selected by the quality are put into the boiling water. Next step, these cocoons are unwinded ,and its length of thread are about 300-900 meters. These thread will be twisted ,which would become lines that could be used for weaving, and the lines is needed to be dyed, which make it more attraction.\
\
Overall, silkworms require four steps to produce cocoon , which need to be manufactured in six steps.\
\
